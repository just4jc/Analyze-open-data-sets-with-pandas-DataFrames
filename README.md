# Analyze-open-data-sets-with-pandas-DataFrames
In this notebook, you'll learn how to use open data from the data sets on the Data Science Experience home page in a Python notebook. You will load, clean, and explore the data with pandas DataFrames.   Some familiarity with Python is recommended.  The data sets for this notebook are from the World Development Indicators (WDI) data set. The WDI data set is a statistical benchmark that helps measure the progress of human development. The WDI data set draws on data from the World Bank and more than 30 partners. You'll look at seven key development variables, sorted by country and year.
